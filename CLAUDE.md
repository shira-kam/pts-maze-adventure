# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
"PT's Maze Adventure" is a sophisticated educational HTML5 Canvas maze game featuring PT the elephant. The game spans 10 levels with progressive difficulty, incorporating multiple educational puzzle types, advanced movement mechanics, comprehensive scoring systems, and extensive debug capabilities. Built as a single-page application with no external dependencies.

## Running the Game
**IMPORTANT**: This game requires a local HTTP server to function properly due to browser security restrictions on loading local files (CSV, text files, images). The game dynamically loads level data from CSV files and educational content from text files, which browsers block when opening HTML files directly from the file system.

### Setup Options:
1. **Python**: `python -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. **Node.js**: `npx http-server` or `npx serve`
3. **VS Code**: Use "Live Server" extension
4. **Any local web server** that can serve static files

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or appropriate port) to play the game.

#### **Cumulative Score (Black Heart üñ§)**
- **Session Tracking**: Accumulates all hearts gained/lost across entire browser session
- **Continuous Updates**: Updates in real-time alongside level score changes
- **Reset Behavior**: Resets to 0 only on browser refresh/restart (no localStorage persistence)
- **Starting Hearts**: Includes initial hearts when starting each new level (once per level attempt)
- **Purpose**: Shows total progress across all levels played in current session

#### **Display Format**
- **Location**: Top-left of game area in blue text (`#4169E1`) matching level indicator
- **Format**: `‚ù§Ô∏è 5 | üñ§ 23` (level score | cumulative score)
- **Updates**: Both scores update simultaneously when hearts are gained/lost

### Scoring and Progression

## Common Development Patterns

### File Loading Pattern
```javascript
// Standard pattern for loading level assets
const promises = [
    loadMazeFromCSV(level),
    loadWordListFromFile(level),
    loadTextures(level)
];
Promise.all(promises).then(() => initializeLevel());
```

### Puzzle Validation Pattern
```javascript
// Standard validation with difficulty-based scoring
if (isCorrect) {
    updateScore(1);
    door.open = true;
    completeRocketBoostMovement(); // If rocket boost active
} else {
    handleIncorrectAnswer(door, attempts);
}
```

### Debug Feature Pattern
```javascript
// Consistent debug mode activation and testing
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    if (e.shiftKey && e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'D') {
        toggleDebugMode();
    }
});
```
