# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
"PT's Maze Adventure" is a sophisticated educational HTML5 Canvas maze game featuring multiple playable characters. The game spans 10 levels with progressive difficulty, incorporating multiple educational puzzle types, advanced movement mechanics, comprehensive scoring systems, and extensive debug capabilities. Built as a single-page application with no external dependencies and fully dynamic character support.

## Running the Game
**IMPORTANT**: This game requires a local HTTP server to function properly due to browser security restrictions on loading local files (CSV, text files, images). The game dynamically loads level data from CSV files and educational content from text files, which browsers block when opening HTML files directly from the file system.

### Setup Options:
1. **Python**: `python -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. **Node.js**: `npx http-server` or `npx serve`
3. **VS Code**: Use "Live Server" extension
4. **Any local web server** that can serve static files

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or appropriate port) to play the game.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Files Structure
- **`index.html`**: Complete game implementation (4000+ lines) containing all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and game logic
- **`game-config.json`**: Comprehensive configuration file controlling levels, characters, and puzzles
- **`config-manager.js`**: Configuration management utility for dynamic loading
- **Level directories** (`level-1/` through `level-10/`): Each contains complete asset sets
- **Educational data files**: `digraph-sounds.txt`, `digraph-emojis.txt`, `distractors.txt`, `emoji-names.txt`
- **Character assets**: Movement sprites, celebration animations, bonus sprites, game over sprites

### Game States and Flow
1. **Character Selection**: Choose from dynamically loaded characters
2. **Difficulty Selection**: Easy Peasy/Neutral (5 hearts) vs Hard Mode (3 hearts)
3. **Level Selection**: Interactive grid showing all levels with texture previews
4. **Level Progression**: Player-driven level selection after each completion
5. **Puzzle Interactions**: Modal-based educational challenges
6. **Special Mechanics**: Rocket boost, heart collection, bonus systems
7. **Completion Screens**: Level celebrations, level selection, final scoring when all complete
8. **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive testing interface (Shift+Ctrl+D activation)

## Dynamic Character System

### Character Support
The game features a fully dynamic character system that supports multiple playable characters:

**Current Characters:**
- **PT the Elephant**: Original character with full asset set
- **Enderman**: Dark mysterious character with complete animation support

**Character Assets Required:**
- **Movement sprite**: 6-frame sprite sheet (960x160 pixels, SVG or PNG)
- **Celebration sprites**: Per-level celebration animations (PNG sprite sheets)
- **Game over sprite**: Character-specific game over animation
- **Bonus sprites**: Rocket boost mode sprites for levels 9-10

### Adding New Characters
To add a new character, simply:

1. **Add character configuration** to `game-config.json`:
```json
"NewCharacter": {
  "name": "Character Display Name",
  "movement": "NewCharacter-sprite.svg",
  "celebration": "NewCharacter-celebrate.png",
  "gameOver": "NewCharacter-game-over.png",
  "bonus": {
    "9": "level-9/NewCharacter-Bonus-Sprite.svg",
    "10": "level-10/NewCharacter-Bonus-Sprite.svg"
  },
  "description": "Character description for display"
}
```

2. **Provide required assets** in appropriate directories
3. **No code changes needed** - character will automatically appear in:
   - Character selection screen with sprite preview
   - Debug mode character selection
   - All gameplay functionality (movement, celebration, game over, bonus)

### Character Selection Flow
- **Character Selection Screen**: First screen, dynamically loads available characters
- **Sprite Preview**: Shows last frame of movement sprite for character identification
- **Dynamic Loading**: Character sprites loaded asynchronously before gameplay
- **Debug Integration**: Debug mode includes character selection with celebration testing

## Configuration-Driven System

### Main Configuration File
The game is designed to be fully configurable through a main JSON configuration file. This allows:
- Adding new levels by creating level folders and updating config
- Adding new characters by providing assets and config entries
- Removing levels by removing them from config
- Configuring puzzle difficulties and constraints per level
- Setting celebration animation frame counts
- Controlling level availability (game vs debug-only)

### Dynamic Level System
- **Level folders**: Each level has its own directory with required assets
- **Asset loading**: Textures and data loaded dynamically from level folders
- **Level discovery**: Game reads configuration to determine available levels
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when assets are missing

## Difficulty Settings

### User Selection
Chosen at session start and applied to all levels completed during the session:

- **Easy Peasy**: Start with 5 lives, lose 1 point per wrong answer
- **Neutral**: Start with 5 lives, lose 1 point for first wrong answer, 2 points for second
- **Hard Mode**: Start with 3 lives, lose 2 points per wrong answer

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY** - Only modify if necessary due to refactoring

## Scoring System

### Score Tracking
- **Level Score**: Red heart (‚ù§Ô∏è) - current level progress
- **Cumulative Score**: Black heart (üñ§) - session-wide total
- **Display**: Top-left corner during gameplay
- **Game Over**: At 0 level score, shows score breakdown with skull emoji for death level
- **Completion**: After all levels, shows final score breakdown

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY** - Only modify to make screens dynamic

## Level Structure

### Level Assets
Each level directory contains:
- **`grid.csv`**: Maze layout with texture codes
- **`Word-List.txt`**: Educational content for word-emoji puzzles
- **Texture files**: `open.png`, `wall.png`, `endpoint.png`, etc.
- **`celebrate.png`**: Level-specific celebration animation
- **Special textures**: `heart.png`, `bonus.png`, puzzle-specific textures

### Texture System
Dynamic texture loading based on grid CSV and configuration:
- **Path**: `open.png` (denoted by "o" in grid)
- **Wall**: `wall.png` (denoted by empty space in grid)
- **Endpoint**: `endpoint.png` (denoted by "w" in grid)
- **Hearts**: `heart.png` (denoted by "h" in grid)
- **Bonus**: `bonus.png` (denoted by "b" in grid)
- **Puzzles**: Various textures based on puzzle type codes

### Implementation Status
üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Creating dynamic texture loading system

### Future Texture System Enhancements
**Note**: Current texture system works well. These improvements are for future consideration:

1. **Better Texture Fallback System**
   - Config-specified fallback levels when textures fail to load
   - Robust error handling for missing assets
   - Asset validation during development

2. **Grid-Based Texture Discovery**
   - Scan grid.csv to determine which puzzle textures are actually needed
   - Eliminate loading unused puzzle textures per level
   - Dynamic texture requirements based on actual maze content

3. **Asset Bundle Validation**
   - Development-time checking for level completeness
   - Missing asset detection and reporting
   - Minimum asset requirements for level playability

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when texture files are missing
   - Better logging and debugging for texture loading issues
   - Automatic fallback to color-based rendering when needed

These improvements maintain the current `level-${number}` folder structure and numbered level system that works well for pre-literate users.

## Special Features

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **FULLY DYNAMIC** - All debug features now use configuration-driven character and level systems

## Technical Implementation

### Character System Architecture
The character system is built on a fully dynamic foundation:

**Key Components:**
- **ConfigManager**: Handles character configuration loading and validation
- **Character Selection Screen**: Dynamically generates buttons from config
- **Character Sprites**: Supports both SVG and PNG sprite formats
- **Asset Loading**: Asynchronous character sprite loading with fallbacks

**Core Functions:**
- `generateCharacterButtons()`: Creates character selection from config
- `loadCharacterSprites()`: Loads character assets based on selection
- `generateDebugCharacterSelection()`: Creates debug mode character options
- `reloadDebugCelebrationSprites()`: Updates debug sprites when character changes

### Sprite System
**Movement Sprites**: 6-frame horizontal sprite sheets (960x160 pixels)
- Frame 1-2: Right-facing movement
- Frame 3-4: Left-facing movement  
- Frame 5-6: Up/down movement
- **SVG Support**: Uses CSS background positioning for frame extraction
- **PNG Support**: Uses HTML5 Canvas for frame extraction

**Celebration Sprites**: Per-level PNG sprite sheets with configurable frame counts
- **Dynamic Loading**: Based on character and level from config
- **Frame Configuration**: Set via `animation.celebrationFrames` in config
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when sprites unavailable

### Configuration Integration
**Character Config Structure**:
```json
"characterName": {
  "name": "Display Name",
  "movement": "path/to/movement-sprite.svg",
  "celebration": "path/to/celebration.png",
  "gameOver": "path/to/game-over.png",
  "bonus": {
    "9": "path/to/bonus-sprite-level-9.svg",
    "10": "path/to/bonus-sprite-level-10.svg"
  }
}
```

**Dynamic Discovery**: Game automatically detects available characters from config
**Asset Paths**: Supports both absolute and relative paths for character assets
**Validation**: ConfigManager provides fallback handling for missing character data

### Development Patterns
**Adding Characters**: 
1. Add config entry to `game-config.json`
2. Provide required asset files
3. No code changes needed - fully automatic

**Character Selection Flow**:
1. User selects character ‚Üí `game.selectedCharacter` updated
2. Difficulty selection ‚Üí Character sprites loaded via `loadCharacterSprites()`
3. Level gameplay ‚Üí Character sprites used for movement, celebration, game over
4. Debug mode ‚Üí Character selection dynamically populated from config

**Error Handling**:
- Missing sprites fall back to placeholder graphics
- Missing character configs default to PT
- Console logging for debugging asset loading issues

## Refactoring Goals
