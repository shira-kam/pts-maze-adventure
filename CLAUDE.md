# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
"PT's Maze Adventure" is an educational HTML5 Canvas maze game featuring PT the elephant. The game provides a dynamic level system with configurable educational puzzles, comprehensive scoring, and extensive debug capabilities. Built as a single-page application with no external dependencies.

## Running the Game
**IMPORTANT**: This game requires a local HTTP server to function properly due to browser security restrictions on loading local files (CSV, text files, images). The game dynamically loads level data from CSV files and educational content from text files, which browsers block when opening HTML files directly from the file system.

### Setup Options:
1. **Python**: `python -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. **Node.js**: `npx http-server` or `npx serve`
3. **VS Code**: Use "Live Server" extension
4. **Any local web server** that can serve static files

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or appropriate port) to play the game.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Files Structure
- **`index.html`**: Complete game implementation containing all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and game logic
- **`game-config.json`**: Main configuration file (currently being refactored)
- **Level directories**: Each contains complete asset sets and configuration
- **Educational data files**: `digraph-sounds.txt`, `digraph-emojis.txt`, `distractors.txt`, `emoji-names.txt`
- **Modular puzzle files**: Individual JavaScript files for each puzzle type

### Game Flow
1. **Difficulty Selection**: Easy Peasy/Neutral (5 hearts) vs Hard Mode (3 hearts)
2. **Level Selection**: Dynamic grid showing configured levels
3. **Level Progression**: Player-driven level selection after each completion
4. **Puzzle Interactions**: Modal-based educational challenges
5. **Special Mechanics**: Heart collection, bonus/boost system
6. **Completion Screens**: Level celebrations, level selection, final scoring

## Configuration-Driven System

### Main Configuration File
The game is designed to be fully configurable through a main JSON configuration file. This allows:
- Adding new levels by creating level folders and updating config
- Removing levels by removing them from config
- Configuring puzzle difficulties and constraints per level
- Setting celebration animation frame counts
- Controlling level availability (game vs debug-only)

### Dynamic Level System
- **Level folders**: Each level has its own directory with required assets
- **Asset loading**: Textures and data loaded dynamically from level folders
- **Level discovery**: Game reads configuration to determine available levels
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when assets are missing

## Difficulty Settings

### User Selection
Chosen at session start and applied to all levels completed during the session:

- **Easy Peasy**: Start with 5 lives, lose 1 point per wrong answer
- **Neutral**: Start with 5 lives, lose 1 point for first wrong answer, 2 points for second
- **Hard Mode**: Start with 3 lives, lose 2 points per wrong answer

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY** - Only modify if necessary due to refactoring

## Scoring System

### Score Tracking
- **Level Score**: Red heart (‚ù§Ô∏è) - current level progress
- **Cumulative Score**: Black heart (üñ§) - session-wide total
- **Display**: Top-left corner during gameplay
- **Game Over**: At 0 level score, shows score breakdown with skull emoji for death level
- **Completion**: After all levels, shows final score breakdown

### Implementation Status
‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY** - Only modify to make screens dynamic

## Level Structure

### Level Assets
Each level directory contains:
- **`grid.csv`**: Maze layout with texture codes
- **`Word-List.txt`**: Educational content for word-emoji puzzles
- **Texture files**: `open.png`, `wall.png`, `endpoint.png`, etc.
- **`celebrate.png`**: Level-specific celebration animation
- **Special textures**: `heart.png`, `bonus.png`, puzzle-specific textures

### Texture System
Dynamic texture loading based on grid CSV and configuration:
- **Path**: `open.png` (denoted by "o" in grid)
- **Wall**: `wall.png` (denoted by empty space in grid)
- **Endpoint**: `endpoint.png` (denoted by "w" in grid)
- **Hearts**: `heart.png` (denoted by "h" in grid)
- **Bonus**: `bonus.png` (denoted by "b" in grid)
- **Puzzles**: Various textures based on puzzle type codes

### Implementation Status
üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Creating dynamic texture loading system

### Future Texture System Enhancements
**Note**: Current texture system works well. These improvements are for future consideration:

1. **Better Texture Fallback System**
   - Config-specified fallback levels when textures fail to load
   - Robust error handling for missing assets
   - Asset validation during development

2. **Grid-Based Texture Discovery**
   - Scan grid.csv to determine which puzzle textures are actually needed
   - Eliminate loading unused puzzle textures per level
   - Dynamic texture requirements based on actual maze content

3. **Asset Bundle Validation**
   - Development-time checking for level completeness
   - Missing asset detection and reporting
   - Minimum asset requirements for level playability

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when texture files are missing
   - Better logging and debugging for texture loading issues
   - Automatic fallback to color-based rendering when needed

These improvements maintain the current `level-${number}` folder structure and numbered level system that works well for pre-literate users.

## Special Features

### Heart Collection
- **Grid Code**: "h"
- **Texture**: `heart.png`
- **Behavior**: Adds 1 point to score, texture changes to open path
- **Implementation**: ‚úÖ Working correctly

### Bonus/Boost System
