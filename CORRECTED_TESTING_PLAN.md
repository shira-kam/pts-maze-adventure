### 6. **Level 2 Functionality**
- **Action**: Select Level 2, test math door
- **Expected**: Same behavior as Level 1

### 7. **Level 3 Functionality**
- **Action**: Select Level 3, test math door  
- **Expected**: Same behavior as Level 1

## **INTEGRATION TESTING** (Critical!)

### 8. **Other Puzzle Types Still Work**
- **Action**: Test reading doors (teal), letter doors (purple), emoji doors (orange)
- **Expected**: All use original system, work exactly as before

### 9. **Higher Level Math Doors**
